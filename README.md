# CSE_351

This coursework follows the class CSE 351 taught at University of Washington. I followed the [Spring 2019](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/19sp/) version of this course.

Examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level languages are implemented.



## Topics Covered

We followed the book **Computer SYstems: A Programmer's Perspective (2ed) ** by Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron. We covered the following chapters and material:


* Chapter 1: A Tour of Computer Systems
	- Basic overview of the material
* Chapter 2: Representating and Manipulating Information
	- Binary representations of integers, floats, strings
	- bitwise and logical operations, shifts
	- Integer arithmetic
* Chapter 3: Machine-Level Representations of Programs
	- Machine-level code
	- data movement
	- x86 assembly (loops, jumps, branching)
	- Procedures, the (call) stack, recursion
	- Arrays!
	- GDB debugger
	- Buffer Overflow
* Chapter 6: The Memory Hierarchy
	- RAM vs Disk vs SSD
	- Cache Cache Cache (associativity, reads vs writes, etc)
	- Writing Cache-friendly code
* Chapter 7 (self-study): Linking
* Chapter 8: Exceptional Control Flow
	- Exception Handling
	- Processes
* Chapter 9: Virtual Memory
	- Physical vs virtual addressing
	- Page tables, hits, faults, etc
	- VM in memory management and protection.
