# CSE_351

This coursework follows the class CSE 351 taught at University of Washington. I followed the [Spring 2019](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/19sp/) version of this course.

Examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level languages are implemented.
